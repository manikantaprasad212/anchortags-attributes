    Sriya, after winning the VJ hunt by SS Music, started hosting shows such as Connect and Phonetastic. However, she cited that she needed five auditions before being selected.[8] She became highly popular as 'VJ Sriya' on SS music, becoming familiar among young viewers.[9][8] She then accepted her first acting assignment for a Telugu film, in spite of her parents' aversion to her acting in films, citing that she signed the contract when her father was asleep.[8] Her debut release, however, happened to be Balaji Sakthivel's directorial debut Samurai, in which she played a supporting character alongside Vikram. Her maiden Telugu release Appudappudu failed at the box office, following which she did not work in films for over a year.[8] Her next release was in 2004, when she debuted in Malayalam with the Mammootty-starrer Black. She played the role of a young Tamil village woman who comes to town in search of her missing husband,[10][11] carrying a "thoroughly de-glamourised look" in the film, totally contrary to her real-life look,[9][12] with director Renjith, on his decision to cast her for the role, citing that she had a "very Dravidian face".[13] Sriya considered this film as her highest point of career for having acted alongside Malayalam actor Mammootty.[13] Later that year, she also starred in</p>
